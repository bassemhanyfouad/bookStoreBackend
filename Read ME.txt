This is the backend part of the application implemented using spring boot and H2 database

To Run:
1) run this command : mvnspring-boot:run
2) call the endpoint : localhost:8080/task/initialize
which will persist all data in the database

Endpoints:
1) localhost:8080/task/books   -> gets all books
2) localhost:8080/task/books/{bookid}  -> gets a specific book + updates its views + triggers similarity calculations asynchronously
3) localhost:8080/task/books/{bookid}/similarBooks  -> finds all similar books to this book

Comments:
The application is fully tested from the UI.. However  unit tests and integration tests are missing for the BookController
But there are a lot of other unit tests and integration tests for the rest of the classes.
